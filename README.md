# Event-specific Image Importance
This is a implementation of the paper "Event-specific Image Importance". Project Page: http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~yuw176/event-curation.html
- For Piecewise Ranking Loss implementation, please refer to caffe/src/caffe/layers/piecewise_ranking_loss_layer.cpp.  
- Piecewise Ranking loss has several parameters: 
  * L2 or L1 (default L2)
  * two margins (default margin1=0.1, margin2=0.3)
- For example of training a Siamese network for event-specific image importance on CUFED dataset, please refer to caffe/image_importance_example/
